## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project and start running the video classification pipeline on your local machine.

---

### 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KishoreMuruganantham/AI-Powered-Video-Classification.git
    cd video-classification
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

### 🔄 Usage

Run the pipeline by executing the main script:
```bash
python main.py --input_path /path/to/videos --output_path /path/to/results
```

Parameters:
- `--input_path`: Path to the folder containing video files.
- `--output_path`: Path where results and predictions will be saved.

---

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The pipeline includes the following steps:

1. **Frame Extraction**: Extracts key frames from video using OpenCV.
2. **Preprocessing**: Scales and normalizes frames.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes pretrained models like ResNet or MobileNet.
4. **Classification**: Trains deep learning models (e.g., CNNs or LSTMs) for final predictions.

## 🛠️ Gemini Integration

This project integrates with **Gemini**, a cutting-edge platform for efficient machine learning workflows. Key benefits of using Gemini include:

- **Scalability**: Seamlessly scales from small datasets to large-scale deployments.
- **Optimized Training**: Reduces training time with distributed processing.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Easily track, compare, and reproduce experiments.

To enable Gemini integration, ensure you have your Gemini API key configured:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Use the following command to run the pipeline with Gemini:
```bash
python main.py --use_gemini --input_path /path/to/videos --output_path /path/to/results
```
